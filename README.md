## Overview

The idea of this project is to learn about using Flask, a web framework written in Python.

The concept behind the project was to build a website to inform users about working out in the gym.

The USP of the site is its Exercise Recommender, driven by a script previously built currently on my [profile](https://github.com/IshNjie/Exercise_Recommender).

The user will select what exercise they want to view "similar" exercises for
